# Oct 2018 - Present *Diamond Light Source*
## **Graduate Software Systems Engineer**

[Diamond Light Source](https://www.diamond.ac.uk) is the UK's national synchrotron.
If you're new to synchrotrons, like I used to be, they are circular particle accelerators which are carefully designed to produce
extremely bright beams of light across the electromagentic spectrum, from infra-red to x-rays.
This provides the basis for a wide range of research at the molecular level and below.
There are many synchrotrons around the world, specialised for different applications relevant to the research done in the country.

As a member of the controls team, I am working to support the research activites by ensuring that motors move, detectors measure and
safety systems protect, when they are needed, together.
This is an incredibly complicated task, as there are millions of data points to track and provide input into.
Diamond uses an open source control system for this purpose known as [EPICS](https://epics.anl.gov/).
Learning about the intricacies of EPICS and contributing to the global collaboration is an ongoing task for all our engineers.
In July I represented Diamond at the EPICS conference at [ITER](https://www.iter.org/), discussing our work into using web
applications for display and control.

In my latest project, I have been working to implement a machine learning algorithm to aid [Macomolecular Crystallography (MX)](https://www.diamond.ac.uk/Instruments/Techniques/Diffraction/MX) work at Diamond.
The general concept it to look at data as it comes out and provide users with an idea about which experiments will yield better data.
This project is documented here: https://python-topaz3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

As part of this project, I worked on the automated data analysis infrastructure, and led meetings across teams to lay out a path for the future.

### Key Skills

- Working as part of a much larger company than I have experienced before
- EPICS Control System
- Large scale build and deployment
- Continuous Integration (CI) and associated tools
- Git version control
- Advanced Python
- Presenting to a wide range of audiences (EPICS Collaboration vs public tours of Diamond)

# Oct 2018 - Present *Diamond Light Source*
## **Graduate Software Systems Engineer**

[Diamond Light Source](https://www.diamond.ac.uk) is the UK's national synchrotron.
If you're new to synchrotrons, like I used to be, they are circular particle accelerators which are carefully designed to produce
extremely bright beams of light across the electromagentic spectrum, from infra-red to x-rays.
This provides the basis for a wide range of research at the molecular level and below.
There are many synchrotrons around the world, specialised for different applications relevant to the research done in the country.

As a member of the controls team, I am working to support the research activites by ensuring that motors move, detectors measure and
safety systems protect, when they are needed, together.
This is an incredibly complicated task, as there are millions of data points to track and provide input into.
Diamond uses an open source control system for this purpose known as [EPICS](https://epics.anl.gov/).
Learning about the intricacies of EPICS and contributing to the global collaboration is an ongoing task for all our engineers.
In July I represented Diamond at the EPICS conference at [ITER](https://www.iter.org/), discussing our work into using web
applications for display and control.

The first year of the Graduate scheme is split into four projects, so far I have completed three:

### Upgrading control screens on I16 beamline

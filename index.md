I'm an engineer through and through. I love to find problems, think about them a lot and then find a creative solution. My favourite puzzles so far have been a blend of software and electronics, but in my mind, communicating with people is just as, if not more, important than writing code and being happy when your prototype finally works.

This website is a place for me to store a history of what I have worked on, and hopefully explore new ideas going forward. I am still learning all the time - in fact, the more I learn, the more I realise that the people I look up to don't know everything. It is their ability to understand what they are being told and trust the people they work with that defines their success. So I'm trying to be a bit more like that.
